## üîß Configuration

### Application Properties
The main configuration is in `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    driverClassName: "org.postgresql.Driver"
    url: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/bootcamp_2504p"
    username: "postgres"
    password: "admin1234"
  jpa:
    show-sql: true
    hibernate.ddl-auto: update
```

### Environment Variables
You can override database settings with environment variables:
- `DB_URL`: Database connection URL
- `DB_USERNAME`: Database username
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password

## üß™ Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
mvn test
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the application
2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
3. Use the web interface to test all features
4. Monitor the console for application logs

## üìà Business Logic

### Loan Calculation
The system uses the standard loan payment formula:
```
P = L[c(1 + c)^n]/[(1 + c)^n - 1]
```
Where:
- P = Monthly payment
- L = Loan amount
- c = Monthly interest rate (annual rate √∑ 12)
- n = Total number of payments

### Payment Processing
1. Calculate interest for the current period
2. Apply payment to interest first, then principal
3. Update remaining balance
4. Track payment history
5. Update loan status if fully paid

### Loan Status Flow
1. **PENDING**: Initial application status
2. **APPROVED**: Loan approved by admin
3. **ACTIVE**: Loan disbursed and active
4. **PAID_OFF**: Loan fully repaid
5. **REJECTED**: Loan application rejected
6. **DEFAULTED**: Loan in default
7. **CANCELLED**: Loan cancelled

## üö® Error Handling
